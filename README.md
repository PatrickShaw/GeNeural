**Note:** Neural.NET is currently undergoing a shift from being C# library to C++/CLI wrapper for [neural](https://github.com/PatrickShaw/neural). 
See the master branch for the original neural network library: [GeNeural](https://github.com/PatrickShaw/neural.NET/tree/master).
# Neural.NET
Neural.NET is a [C++/CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B/CLI) wrapper for [Neural](https://github.com/PatrickShaw/neural). You can easily use it with  C#, VB.NET and, of course, C++/CLI.
